Hello World 
 <h1>
   Is Earth Our Home?
  </h1>
 <p1>
   The earth is being ravaged due to our reckless actions; fresh air becomes scarcer every day while the natural
calamities grow fiercer. Hurricanes, floods, forest fires and earthquakes are taking place with greater frequency.
Today, global warming is at an all-time high, causing glacier to melt, and resulting in sea level rise every year. In
2017 alone, there were eight notable hurricanes, the most prominent of these were Harvey, Irma and Maria. These
hurricanes resulted in a total damage of more than $200 Billion as calculated by National Geographic. Thousands
of hectares of forests are being devoured every single day to fuel our lavish lifestyles, the lush green earth turning
into a mesh of steel and concrete, innumerable species of animals becoming extinct while the natural ecosystem
is being disrupted to extreme extents - this is the reality we wake up to every single day, yet we remain oblivious to
its implications. Why should we care? It is not our home being destroyed, is it? But I beg to differ. Earth is our
home.
